Problem Statement 1

Scenario:
How might we help dispatchers retrieve vital personal infomation about casualties from bystanders who made the emergency call?
If the person requiring medical attention had created a profile containing the necessary personal information in advance using an SCDF ChatBot Service, bystanders can release these information to the dispatcher upon request.

We created a ChatBot using Watson Assistant 'SCDF Emergency Bot'
